# Image-Recognition
This project is for Image Recognition using CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets.

## About the Project
This project focuses on image recognition using CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets for image classification. The model is trained to classify user-provided images into different categories.

## Steps to Use the Project
1. Use `main.py` to get the model if you want to create it from scratch. However, the model is already included in this project.
2. After creating the model, use it in `app.py` to get the output.
3. Run `app.py`.
4. Follow the local host for using the web UI.
